# SLH Bucket Manager

This administrator tool will allow content authors and administrators to easily manage their current items hosted inside a bucket folter. 
As you might know, sometimes it's hard to visualize content items that live under bucket folders and as a content manager you usually use the search (ootb) in order to find a specific item, but what if these bucketable items are shown in a friendly interface where you can see exactly which items are bucket folders and their children.
